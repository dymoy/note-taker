## Description 
This web tool is a note-taking application that allows the user to view, save, and delete notes.  

The goal of this project is to utilize the Express.js back-end framework to build API routes with Node.js and to successfully deploy the application using [Heroku](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-nodejs). 
  
The following routes are implemented in the `routes.js` file:  
- GET API route that will send all existing notes to the client:  
`app.get('/api/notes', (req, res) => {...});`

- POST API route that will receive a new note to save on the request body, add it to the `db.json` file, and then return the new note to the client:  
`app.post('/api/notes', (req, res) => {...});`

- DELETE API route that will remove the note with the requested id paramater from the `db.json` file and then return the updated array of existing notes to the client:  
`app.delete('/api/notes/:id', (req, res) => {})`

- HTML route that returns the `notes.html` file:  
`app.get('/notes', (req, res) => {...})`

- HTML route that returns the `index.html` file:  
`app.get('*', (req, res) => {})`
